The rapid evolution of web 2.0 technologies such as OSN applications, has led to the
continuous generation of an enormous volume of digital heterogeneous data being
published at an unprecedented rate. These technologies have significantly changed the
way people communicate and share information among each other in various domains.
Millions of people have shifted from the traditional media channels such as newspapers,
to online social media. In this context, Twitter has gained massive popularity as it provides
an informal platform where people can easily publish and broadcast messages on
different areas across the world. It had a prominent role in spreading awareness of
natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and socio-political events such as the Arab
Spring. This has made Twitter an important source of information for synthesizing
evidence in argumentation, and a goldmine of potential cross domain opportunities for
both businesses and decision makers. However, the exponential amount of user
generated content on this site is too vast for manual analysis. More than 500 million
short-text messages, referred to as “tweets”, are published every day. This requires an
automated and scalable mining process to discover patterns in the unstructured data.
Cluster analysis is the unsupervised process of grouping data instances into relatively
similar categories, without prior understanding of the groups structure or class labels. It
is a prominent component of exploratory data analysis. A subfield of clustering includes
text mining, where large volumes of text are analysed to find patterns between
documents.
